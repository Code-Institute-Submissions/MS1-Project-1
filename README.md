# Milestone One Project: Avenged Sevenfold Website

My website is based around the heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, a band I've followed for a long time.
The reasons I chose this band to base my project around was because of my closeness to their music and love for their band art/ Album covers, they range from simple to heavily detailed but always eyecatching, and this is what my website embodies. My hope for it's users is to be a one-stop location for everything you'd want as a fan and for the band, a way to educate, create interest & revenue but overall be a place for a comunity to connect with Avenged Sevenfold and their music. 
 
## UX
 
**TO BE ADDED
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. **

My website is for existing fans of Avenged Sevenfold and for those looking to discover them. On the other side it is for the band, it provides simple avenues for fans to generate royalty revenue from spotify and to make purchases of merch, the events page also keeps fans informed and will increase numbers for local and smaller shows. This website is the best way for fans and the bands to benefit as it hosts all these features in one place rather than having to find them individually.

#### User Stories

## Testing

To test my website I've used both the laptop I work from and my phone. I've inspected my website using chrome developer tools throughout development in order to see that it is responsive and works  mobile first. I tested using frame width sizes (in pixels): 320-425 for mobiles, 768 for tablets, 1024+ for laptop, desktop and other screen uses. In particular, I have done the following to test each of the user stories:

1. As a fan, I want to be able to navigate around the site using links and a home button, on both desktop and mobile.
    - To test this, I've used the home button and navigation links on my laptop, I've used chrome developer tools to simulate tablet viewing and viewed the site on my mobile going from page to page and back to home to make sure the links are correctly set up.

1. As a fan, I want to be able to access social media links that will take me through to the respective applications.
    - To test this I have clicked each link of my footer and made sure that the page loads in seperate tab and that the loaded site is Avenged Sevenfold's social page for that platform.

1. As a fan, I want to be able to view merchandise on the site.
    - The Merch page iframe is fully functioning and allows filtering, adding items to basket, checkout funtions, inspecting items and searching for specific items, just as the site does outside of the iframe.

1. As a fan, I want to be able to view and listen to music on the site.
    - I've tested every album link of my cards, both the tabs and the links that open spotify to make sure they function and lead to the desired output of the user. 

1. As a fan, I want to be able to sign up for a mailing list to be notified when the band is playing near me.
    - I've tested the events form and have set the action of the form to use a verification site to prove this, with all or any information submitted the button will take you to a submission test checker that shows the information pulled in by the form. This shows me that once the future feature of making the form fully functional the frontend works as desired.


You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.


## Deployment

To deploy my website I enabled Github Pages from my MS1 Project repository and with each push from my local repository, using desktop Github, to my master branch my website was updated.

My website can be downloaded from [Github for local use](https://github.com/louisgreenhall/MS1-Project.git)
