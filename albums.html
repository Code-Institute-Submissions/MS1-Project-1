                        <div id="test12">Nightmare is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Avenged
                            Sevenfold. It was released on July 27, 2010 through Warner Bros. Records. It was produced by
                            Mike Elizondo and mixed in New York City by noted engineer Andy Wallace.[1] Nightmare is the
                            first Avenged Sevenfold recorded without James "The Rev" Sullivan performing drums on all
                            the songs due to his death in December 2009. However, he did write parts that were used for
                            the final recordings, making this the last album he would write on,[2] The Rev's vocals are
                            still on the album as a tribute to him.[1] This is the only album to feature ex-Dream
                            Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, who performed as the drummer for the album in his place, also
                            played with the band for all their tours through the end of 2010, due to his separation with
                            Dream Theater. They then hired drummer Arin Ilejay, who played with the band for the next
                            four years. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA in the United States. The album
                            debuted at number 1 in the Billboard 200. As of December 2016, the album has sold 964,000
                            copies in the United States.[3] The cover of the album features a tribute to Jimmy "The Rev"
                            Sullivan, the tombstone reads "FOREVER" with emphasis on "REV".</div>
