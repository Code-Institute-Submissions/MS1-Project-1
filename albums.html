                        <div id="test2">The Stage is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Avenged
                            Sevenfold, released on October 28, 2016, by Capitol Records. It is the first Avenged
                            Sevenfold album to feature drummer Brooks Wackerman, who joined the band in late 2014 but
                            was not revealed as previous drummer Arin Ilejay's official replacement until Ilejay's
                            departure in 2015, because the band wanted to find a drummer that would "fit in". The Stage
                            is also the band's first album to be released through Capitol Records.
                            Written and recorded throughout 2016, The Stage was musically different for the band,
                            marking a progressive metal sound. It was a surprise release, being the first mainstream
                            heavy metal album without promotion of any kind. It is Avenged Sevenfold's first conceptual
                            album, with its main theme being based on artificial intelligence and self-destruction of
                            society. It is also the band's longest studio album at 73 minutes and 35 seconds, thus
                            beating 2005's City of Evil by almost a minute. In addition to being their longest album,
                            The Stage features their longest song to date, "Exist", with a run-time of 15 minutes and 41
                            seconds.
                            Upon release, the album received critical acclaim. It debuted at number four on the
                            Billboard 200. The title-track was nominated at 60th Annual Grammy Awards in "Best Rock
                            Song" category.</div>

                        <div id="test4">Hail to the King is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Avenged
                            Sevenfold. It was released on August 23, 2013 in New Zealand and Australia, and was released
                            on iTunes on August 27, 2013 and in North America on the same day. The album was produced by
                            Mike Elizondo. Hail to the King is the only Avenged Sevenfold album to feature drummer Arin
                            Ilejay, prior to his departure in July 2015. It is also the first Avenged Sevenfold album
                            without musical contributions from Ilejay's late predecessor, Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan; the
                            bonus track, "St. James", was written in his memory.
                            The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 1 on the Billboard 200.
                            This marks Avenged Sevenfold's second album to top the Billboard chart (the first being
                            Nightmare), as well as their first to reach number 1 in the UK, topping the UK Albums Chart.
                            It also topped the Canadian, Brazilian, Finnish and Irish album charts. Also, the album
                            spawned two number 1 singles on Billboard's Mainstream Rock, Hail to the King, and Shepherd
                            of Fire. The former spent 11 weeks on the top of the chart. On July 16, 2014 the album
                            was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of over 500,000 copies.</div>

                            Sevenfold. It was released on July 27, 2010 through Warner Bros. Records. It was produced by
                            Mike Elizondo and mixed in New York City by noted engineer Andy Wallace. Nightmare is the
                            first Avenged Sevenfold recorded without James "The Rev" Sullivan performing drums on all
                            the songs due to his death in December 2009. However, he did write parts that were used for
                            the final recordings, making this the last album he would write on, The Rev's vocals are
                            still on the album as a tribute to him. This is the only album to feature ex-Dream
                            Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, who performed as the drummer for the album in his place, also
                            played with the band for all their tours through the end of 2010, due to his separation with
                            Dream Theater. They then hired drummer Arin Ilejay, who played with the band for the next
                            four years. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA in the United States. The album
                            debuted at number 1 in the Billboard 200. As of December 2016, the album has sold 964,000
                            copies in the United States. The cover of the album features a tribute to Jimmy "The Rev"
                            Sullivan, the tombstone reads "FOREVER" with emphasis on "REV".</div>

                        <div id="test8">Avenged Sevenfold (also known as A7X, The Deathbat Album or The White Album) is
                            the self-titled fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, released
                            on October 30, 2007. The album, originally slated for an October 16 release, was delayed by
                            two weeks in order to provide more time to complete bonus material and production for the
                            record, including the making of the animated music video for the song "A Little Piece of
                            Heaven". The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200. On September 23, 2008,
                            Avenged Sevenfold was certified Gold by the RIAA. The album has also been released on vinyl.
                            The band supported the album with a tour, beginning a day before the release of the album
                            and ending in 2009. This is their last studio album to feature the drummer The Rev for the
                            full album, who died in December 2009 during the production of the follow-up album
                            Nightmare.
                            Although critical reception to the album was mixed compared to previous releases, Avenged
                            Sevenfold won the Kerrang! Award for Best Album in 2008. In addition, the album was included
                            in Kerrang's "666 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die". As of 2014, it has sold over 960,161
                            copies in the United States and 152,123 copies in the United Kingdom.</div>

                        <div id="test10">City of Evil is the third studio album by Avenged Sevenfold released on June 6,
                            2005 by Warner Records. Co-produced by Andrew Murdock, City of Evil contains a more
                            traditional heavy metal and hard rock sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous two albums,
                            which showcased a predominantly metalcore sound. The album is also notable for the absence
                            of screaming vocals. M. Shadows worked for months before the album's release with vocal
                            coach Ron Anderson, whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell, to achieve a
                            sound that had "grit while still having the tone". In order to increase stamina and strength
                            on the pedals, The Rev would sit for hours practicing until he could get up to 210 beats per
                            minute. The album was ranked No. 63 on Guitar World magazine's "100 Greatest Guitar Albums
                            of All Time". City of Evil also appears in Kerrang!'s "666 Albums You Must Hear Before You
                            Die" and "50 Albums You Need To Hear Before You Die". The album was ranked No. 35 in
                            Kerrang's list of "50 Greatest Metal Albums Ever" in 2016. Rolling Stone listed the album
                            at No. 100 on its list of The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.</div>
